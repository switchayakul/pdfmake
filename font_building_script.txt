For a complete description of use custom fonts in client-side, read the article: Custom fonts (client-side) > via Virtual file system (VFS)

If you don’t want to install gulp and/or just downloaded pdfMake and want to use custom fonts in client-side, you can generate the vfs_fonts.js with an bash-script as well:



#!/bin/sh

if [ -t 1 ]; then
	target="vfs_fonts.js"
else
	target="/dev/stdout"
fi

(
	echo "this.pdfMake = this.pdfMake || {}; this.pdfMake.vfs = {"
	for file in "$@"; do
		file=$1
		filename=$(basename $file)
		filecontent=$(base64 -w 0 $file)
		shift
		echo "\"${filename}\":\"${filecontent}\""
		if [ "$#" -gt 0 ]; then
			echo ","
		fi
	done
	echo "};"
) > "$target"



How to use script:

script.sh font1.ttf font2.ttf font3.ttf
If you are using a mac you need to change this line

		filecontent=$(base64 -w 0 $file)
to (change the flag from -w to -b)

		filecontent=$(base64 -b 0 $file)
GNU coreutils' base64 seems to differ to Apple’s base64 in this flag (which prevents line wrapping).
